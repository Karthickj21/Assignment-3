## ✅ Task 1: Factorial Program

### 📌 File Name:
`Factorial.py`

### 📝 Description:
This Python program calculates the **factorial** of a number entered by the user using a loop. The factorial logic is implemented inside a function called `factorial()`.

### 🔧 How It Works:
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- The program calculates the factorial using a `for` loop.
- The result is printed to the screen.

### ▶️ Sample Output:
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

## ✅ Task 2: Math Module Calculations

### 📌 File Name:
`MathCalculations.py`

### 📝 Description:
This Python program performs three mathematical operations on a user-input number using Python’s built-in `math` module:
- Square root
- Natural logarithm (log base e)
- Sine (in radians)

### 🔧 How It Works:
- The user is prompted to enter a number (decimal or integer).
- The program calculates the square root, log, and sine using:
  - `math.sqrt()`
  - `math.log()`
  - `math.sin()`
- The results are displayed.

### ▶️ Sample Output:
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
